# Welcome to my portfolio! 

I am currently on a learning journey into the low code development world, specifically into Power Platform. 
Within Power Apps, I have developed two canvas apps, a mobile and a tablet version, for a group project pertaining to a gym company entitled "Power Gym Girls". 

Mobile version:

Tablet version:

You can view more details on that [here].

I have also created a model-driven app for the gym to register people interested in on-going promotions and marketing campaigns, either for prospective members or gym members.
