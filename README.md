# Welcome to my portfolio! 

I am currently on a learning journey into the low code development world, specifically into Power Platform. 
Within Power Apps, I have developed two canvas apps, a mobile and a tablet version, for a group project pertaining to a gym company entitled "Power Gym Girls". 

[Mobile version]

I have also created a model-driven app for the gym to register people interested in on-going promotions and marketing campaigns, either for prospective members or gym members.

[Model-driven  App]

Within Power BI, I have built a multiple page report in order to aid the gym to better understand their current standing-point, including analysis on demographics, sports, sign-ups and withdrawls, as well as other crucial information to the business.
