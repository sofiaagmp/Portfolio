# Power Gym Girls Project - Model Driven APP

This app is to be used alongside it's mobile and tablet versions. Through this app, people can fill out a form in order to register for gym promotions or marketing campaigns, and both non and current members can apply. The information is then stored in order to contact them. In this model driven app, there are a few automation and approval flows that ensure that, for example, minors cannot have their information registered and saved without parental consent.
