This tablet app is to be used alongside it's mobile version. It includes some of the same features found in the former, such as user log in, generate a new password and welcome screen. Aside from those, there's a report page where the user can visualize a company report built in Power BI, and two screens where the user can view, edit and delete users from the app and the maintenance logs created in the mobile version.
